This code creates a world in which creatures learn to adapt to their environment through generations using a genetic algorithm. The world itself consists of the creatures, monsters (which the creatures must learn to avoid), and fruit (which the creatures must eat to survive). Eating non-ripe fruit will have adverse affects on a creature.
